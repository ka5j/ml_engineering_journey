# ML Engineering Journey
**AI Engineer + Quant Developer — public learning repo**

This repository tracks my multi-year, disciplined learning program. It’s designed so employers and collaborators can quickly see what I’m studying, how I work, and the artifacts I produce.

## Quick links
- **About this journey:** [ABOUT_THIS_REPO.md](./ABOUT_THIS_REPO.md)
- **Full curriculum:** [CURRICULUM.md](./CURRICULUM.md)
- **Active semester (Year 1 -> Sem 1):**  

## What’s here (simple & consistent)
- **Program years:** `program_years/Year_#/Sem#/…`
  - Each **course** has a single **`LOG.md`** (all sessions go here).
  - Each **lecture** has its own folder under `lectures/` with a tiny `README.md` for links and a `NOTES.md` for brief takeaways.
  - If a lecture needs code or sample inputs, they live in that lecture’s folder (e.g., `lectures/01-What_is_Computation/code/` and `lectures/01-What_is_Computation/datasets/`).

### Example (first course)
```
program_years/Year_1/Sem1/Introduction_to_Computer_Science_and_Programming_in_Python__6.0001__MIT/
├─ LOG.md                     # one file for every study session
├─ lectures/
│  └─ 01-What_is_Computation/
│     ├─ README.md            # official links (video/notes/pset)
│     ├─ NOTES.md             # my brief notes
│     ├─ code/                # small, runnable scripts/notebooks
│     └─ datasets/            # tiny sample inputs only
├─ assignments/               # psets I attempt
└─ exams/                     # only if I attempt them
```

## How I log a session (copy this snippet)
Append this block to the course’s `LOG.md` after each session:

```
### Log 0001 — YYYY-MM-DD
- **Time Spent:** 75m
- **Topics Covered:** L01 — What is Computation; variables vs. values
- **Next Steps:** Start PS1 Q1–2
```

## Principles
- **Clarity over complexity.** One log file per course, tiny lecture folders, minimal overhead.
- **Proof of work.** Short, runnable code where useful; links to sources; concise notes.
- **Privacy & discipline.** No large/private data in Git; only tiny, anonymized samples.
