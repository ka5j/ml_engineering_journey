# Notes â€” Lecture 01: What is Computation
- High-level takeaways:
    - Went over course concepts and rules and way to succeed
    - Went over how computers function at a very abstracted level and   explain how to speak to computers with sequences of steps
    - Went over general coding procedures
    - Went  over basic pyhton knowledge like programs, objects, data types,expressions, arthimetic operators, basic python variable nature

- Definitions / key terms:  
    - Python Program:
        - A sequnce of definitions and commands executed by pyhton interpreter in a shell
    - Commands:
        - Instruct interpreter to do something
    - Objects:
        - Programs manipulate objects
        - Can be Scalar (undivided structure)
        - Can be non-scalar (have an internal structure that can be accessed)
        - Use type(<object>) function in python to determine the specfic type of object 
    - Scalar Objects:
        - int -> Represent integers (ex. 6)
        - float -> Represent real numbers (ex. 4.21)
        - bool -> Represent boolean values (True/False)
        - NoneType -> This type of object represents a null object and has no value
- Examples / gotchas: None.
- Questions to revisit:
