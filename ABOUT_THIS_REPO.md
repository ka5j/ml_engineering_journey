# About This Journey

**Purpose.** This repository documents my multi-year learning program to become a strong **AI Engineer + Quant Developer**. It’s a public, disciplined record of work meant for employers and collaborators who want evidence of skill growth, execution habits, and professional communication.

## What this repository is

- **A transparent portfolio.** Every study block produces code, notes, and tests. You can trace progress day-by-day and week-by-week.
- **A project-driven curriculum.** Each semester includes **1–2 integrated projects** that combine as many course concepts as possible (algorithms, systems, math, and writing).
- **A proof-of-work trail.** Commits, issues, and pull requests show how I plan, implement, test, document, and reflect—mirroring real engineering workflows.

If you want the full course map, see **[`CURRICULUM.md`](./CURRICULUM.md)**.

## What I’m aiming to learn

- **Build reliable software**: write clean code, add tests, and structure projects so others can use and extend them.
- **Think with math**: use calculus, linear algebra, probability, and optimization to make sound, measurable decisions.
- **Engineer AI systems end-to-end**: data handling, modeling, evaluation, deployment, and iteration—with attention to cost, latency, and failure modes.
- **Understand markets and risk**: foundations of electronic trading, market data, and risk management to build trustworthy, compliant systems.
- **Communicate like a professional**: explain choices, trade-offs, and results clearly for both technical and non-technical audiences.

## How I hold myself to a professional bar

- **Tests & CI.** Every new function or module gets at least one test. CI runs on each push/PR.
- **Issues & PRs.** I open an issue per study block and a PR per day. Each PR includes a summary and checkboxes (tests/docs/links).
- **Readable docs.** Each project includes a short report covering: _What changed, Why this approach, Results, Limitations, and Next steps_.
- **Ethics & safety.** I document risks (privacy, bias, misuse) and how I’ve reduced them. If a shortcut would undermine safety or integrity, I don’t take it.

## What “good” looks like (review rubric)

- **Correctness & Tests (40%)** – The code does what it claims and is covered by tests.
- **Performance & Complexity (25%)** – Choices are measured and explained when speed or scale matters.
- **Documentation & Communication (20%)** – Clear README/report with decisions and trade-offs.
- **Design Quality (10%)** – Small, composable modules; clean APIs; maintainable structure.
- **Ethics & Safety (5%)** – Risks identified with mitigations and guardrails.

## Why both AI and Quant?

AI systems increasingly interact with markets, risk, and constraints. Blending **systems + math + markets** produces engineers who can build useful, safe, and cost-aware products—whether for intelligent telemetry, data platforms, or trading and risk tools. This program builds that full stack deliberately.
