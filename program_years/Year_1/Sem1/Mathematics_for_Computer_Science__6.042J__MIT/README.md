# MIT 6.042J — Mathematics for Computer Science

**School:** MIT (OpenCourseWare)  
**Term (as taught):** Fall 2010  
**Instructors:** Prof. Tom Leighton, Dr. Marten van Dijk

## Overview
6.042J is MIT’s discrete mathematics course for CS/EECS. It emphasizes rigorous **definitions and proofs** plus tools you’ll use everywhere in computing: logic and proof methods (induction, strong induction, well-ordering), sets and relations, graph theory, number theory (congruences), asymptotics, counting and discrete probability. Selected topics may also include structural induction, state machines & invariants, recurrences, and generating functions.
